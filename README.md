# Conjugate Gradient Method
This is a R script to try out the conjugate gradient (CG) method. 

A short description of the CG method:
- To solve linear equation Ax = b often requires solving the inverse of A, which is usually computationally intensive.
- Yet, for a special kind of Ax = b, where A is a symmetric, positive-definite matrix, we can solve this equation by doing simple Matrix X vector iteration. 
- Of all thid kind of methods, conjugate gradient method often requires the least iteration time. 
- For a thorough description of this method, please refer to   Shewchuk, Jonathan Richard. "An introduction to the conjugate gradient method without the agonizing pain." (1994).
